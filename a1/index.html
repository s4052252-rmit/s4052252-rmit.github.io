          <p class="answer-para">The very first thing I noticed was the grid of numbered boxes displayed like an advent calendar. This immediately made me curious, as each box felt like a blind box hiding a surprise. The Christmas-inspired 3D icons caught my eye with their playful design, and the calendar motif gave me a sense of anticipation.

        <h2 class="quest-number">03</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">I spent the most time clicking and opening the numbered boxes to see what content was hidden inside. Each one felt like a little blind boxes, so I focused on clicking on each boxes to see what inside.

        <h2 class="quest-number">04</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            The action I repeated most often was hovering over the 3D Christmas elements to see them animate, then dragging them around and clicking to open and close the boxes. This became a playful rhythm: hover, click, reveal, and move.

      <!-- Question 05 -->
      <section class="answer05" id="a5">
        <h2 class="quest-number">05</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experiences?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            The experience is designed to present the author portfolio in a festive, game-like way. Its primary goal seems to be encouraging curiosity and engagement by framing design projects as daily surprises, similar to how an advent calendar builds excitement and discovery.
          </p>

      <!-- Question 06 -->
      <section class="answer06" id="a6">
        <h2 class="quest-number">06</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experiences?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            The calendar grid, interactive icons, and hidden text clearly communicate the goal of exploration. When you click, the revealed paragraphs describe the designer’s inspirations (readings, movies, minimalism, maximalism, typography).
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Question 07 -->
      <section class="answer07" id="a7">
        <h2 class="quest-number">07</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? </h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            This feels like an experience you can explore in different ways: either all at once, by opening every box in one sitting, or gradually, returning multiple times to discover something new. Like a real advent calendar, it suggests pacing but doesn’t restrict you.

      <!-- Question 08 -->
      <section class="answer08" id="a8">
        <h2 class="quest-number">08</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time? </h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            The numbered layout suggests a slow reveal, yet the open-ended interaction design makes it flexible. The designer leaves the choice up to the user, encouraging repeated visits while also allowing for one-time, full exploration.

      <!-- Question 09 -->
        <section class="answer09" id="a9">
        <h2 class="quest-number">09</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            The design references physical advent calendars, Christmas decorations (trees, wreaths, ornaments), and concepts from design theory such as minimalism, maximalism, grid systems, and typography. It also echoes digital forms like interactive art books and online galleries.
          </p>

      <!-- Question 10 -->
      <section class="answer10" id="a10">
        <h2 class="quest-number">10</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            These references tell me to act with curiosity and playfulness. The advent calendar metaphor suggests clicking around like opening gifts, without a fixed order, encouraging exploration and discovery.
          </p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <!-- Question 11 -->
      <section class="answer11" id="a11">
        <h2 class="quest-number">11</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
        <p class="answer-para">
          The references create a festive, joyful, and curious atmosphere. The Christmas visuals make the interaction feel friendly, while the embedded design concepts remind me I'm also learning about serious creative works.

      <!-- Question 12 -->
      <section class="answer12" id="a12">
        <h2 class="quest-number">12</h2>
        <h2 class="quest-header">What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
          <p class="answer-para">
            The most frustrating aspect was that some boxes felt confusing when clicking on, take time to find out which boxes open or not. After the initial excitement, I wanted more depth and variety in what each element revealed and I want some thing more depth than that. Occasionally, the anticipation built by the design wasn’t fully matched by the reward

      <!-- Question 13 --> 
        <section class="answer13" id="a13">

            <h2 class="quest-header">What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
              <p class="answer-para">
                The most satisfying part was the surprise of discovery. Each click revealed something new, whether a project, a design concept, or a whimsical animation. The combination of festive graphics, playful mechanics, and meaningful content turned the portfolio into a game-like exploration that kept me engaged.
